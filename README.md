# SafeBox-DTMF-Project
This repository contains a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project focused on detecting a 6-digit safe code based on DTMF tones. It demonstrates how to sample an input signal, apply IIR band-pass filters to detect DTMF frequencies in real-time, and display relevant data such as FFT Magnitude graphs, Execution Graphs, and CPU/Task load.
